🃏 Memory Card Game (React)

The Memory Card Game is a fun and interactive matching game built using React. The goal is to match pairs of cards by flipping them over. Players select two cards at a time, and if the cards match, they stay revealed; otherwise, they flip back after a short delay. Every game starts with a fresh shuffle for a new challenge! 🔄

✨ Features:
🔀 Dynamic Card Shuffling: Cards are randomly shuffled at the start of every game for a unique experience.

🧠 State Management with React Hooks: Utilizes React’s useState hook to efficiently manage game state (card flips, matches, and resets).

📱 Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI, ensuring the game looks great and plays smoothly on any device (desktop, tablet, or mobile).

🕹️ Interactive Game Logic: Includes logic for matching pairs, timed card flipbacks for mismatches, and a reset button to restart the game.

🎨 Engaging UI: Visually appealing with smooth animations for flipping cards and easy-to-understand game flow.
